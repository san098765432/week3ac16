🏗️ Write Function to Evaluate Equality of Two Values
Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

As a developer, I want to know when two values are equal to one another.


Acceptance Criteria


It's done when I provide two values in function arguments and the function evaluates the values' equality.


It's done if, when the values are strictly equal, the message "They are equal in type and value" is logged.


It's done if, when the two values are equal but not strictly equal, the message "They are equal in value" is logged.


It's done if, when the values are not equal or strictly equal, the message "The values are not equal" is logged.



💡 Hints
How can we use parameters to give a name to the two values that we want to evaluate with the function?



MY NOTES:
 step1: understand the task

task: evaluate two values and find out whether they're equal or not. create a function which will assess this.

 value ----> function evaluates values inputed -----> output in console

 if values are of the same data type AND same value ---> message to be printed is: "They are equal in type and value"

 if values are NOT of the same type but are still of the same value----> messaged to be printed is: "They are equal in value"

 if the values are not equal at all and the value type ASWELL AS the value itself is different----> message to be printed is: "The values are not equal"


what is a parameter within a function?


functions?
a set of instructions
what do you want to happen-> write a function to achieve that.Chunks of instructions can be given a name - they are called functions and procedures.functions return a value.

arguments?
the values we put INTO the function.

you declare a function but you also have to CALL a function and prep the function
